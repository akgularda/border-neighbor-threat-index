> A real-time geopolitical threat assessment system using multilingual NLP and weighted event classification for Türkiye's border regions.

---

## Abstract

The **Border Neighbor Threat Index (BNTI)** is an automated intelligence monitoring system designed to quantify and track geopolitical risk levels across Türkiye's neighboring countries. The system employs a transformer-based multilingual NLP model (XLM-RoBERTa-Large-XNLI) for zero-shot classification of news articles, combined with a modified Goldstein scale weighting scheme to produce a normalized threat index (1.0â€“10.0) for each monitored region.

The index is updated hourly via automated pipelines and serves as an early warning indicator for regional security developments enabling continuous situational awareness without manual intervention.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

The system monitors **50+ RSS/Atom feeds** from regional news outlets across seven countries in their native languages:

| Country  | Languages | Primary Sources |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Armenia  | Armenian, English | Aravot, 168.am, News.am, Hetq |
| Georgia  | Georgian, English | IPN, Radio Tavisupleba, Netgazeti |
| Greece   | Greek, English | Kathimerini, Skai, News247, In.gr |
| Iran     | Persian, English | IRNA, ISNA, Fars News, Tasnim |
| Iraq     | Arabic, Kurdish | Rudaw, Kurdistan24, Al Mayadeen |
| Syria    | Arabic, English | Enab Baladi, SANA, Al Arabiya |
| Bulgaria | Bulgarian, English | Dnevnik, 24 Chasa, Nova.bg |

Data is fetched hourly with automatic retry mechanisms and cached to prevent duplicate processing.

### 2. Natural Language Processing

Each article headline is processed using **XLM-RoBERTa-Large-XNLI**, a cross-lingual transformer model trained for natural language inference. This architecture enables:

- **Multilingual understanding** across 100+ languages without language-specific training data
- **Zero-shot classification** into predefined threat categories using entailment-based inference
- **Confidence scoring** (0.0â€“1.0) for each classification decision

Headlines are displayed in English (auto-translated) with the original language available on hover for verification.

### 3. Threat Categorization

Articles are classified into categories with associated weights based on a **Modified Goldstein Scale**:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Military Conflict | +10.0 | Active warfare, kinetic operations |
| Terrorist Act | +9.0 | Terrorism, insurgent attacks |
| Violent Protest | +7.0 | Riots, civil unrest with violence |
| Political Crisis | +6.0 | Coups, instability, escalations |
| Border Security | +5.0 | Border incidents, migration pressure |
| Economic Crisis | +4.0 | Sanctions, economic collapse |
| Humanitarian | +3.0 | Refugee crises, disasters |
| Diplomatic Tension | +2.5 | Expelled diplomats, warnings |
| Peaceful Diplomacy | âˆ’2.0 | Treaties, agreements |
| Neutral | 0.0 | Non-threat events |

### 4. Index Calculation

The per-country threat index is computed as:

```
I_country = Î£(w_i Ã— c_i Ã— d_i) / N
```

Where:
- `w_i` = category weight for event *i*
- `c_i` = model confidence score (0â€“1)
- `d_i` = temporal decay (exponential, Ï„ = 24h)
- `N` = normalization factor

The composite BNTI is the weighted average across all monitored countries, scaled to 1.0â€“10.0.

### 5. Threat Classification Thresholds

| Level | Score | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Stable** | 1.0 â€“ 3.9 | Normal background risk |
| **Elevated** | 4.0 â€“ 6.9 | Heightened monitoring advised |
| **Critical** | 7.0 â€“ 10.0 | Active crisis indicators |

### 6. Forecasting

Short-term trend prediction uses **Weighted Linear Regression** with exponentially decaying weights favoring recent observations. This provides 6â€“24 hour directional indicators while acknowledging inherent forecast uncertainty in geopolitical systems.
